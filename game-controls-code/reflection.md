The keypad controls were fun and easy to code using the pyautogui package. 
They are also well known controls, so they were intuitive to use and didn't require users to learn something new.
The mousepad controls were also incredibly intuitive and natural, making them easy to use, and utilized a platform
users have familiarity with. 
The color tracking was really cool, but was a little fatiguing to wave around an item to control a game. 
I could see the functionality of something like this for other projects, but for gaming, wasn't accessible and was
outweighed by the easier, logical controls we know and love like the keypad.
The finger counting was similarly not accessible for everyone and was really not natural. It requires users to learn 
a completely new style of gaming and was really unintuitive. (Why would holding up three fingers equate to going right?) 
If there was some more logical association, like pointing down to go down instead of holding up four fingers, this might improve this method, but it's still a little cumbersome.
Finally, the voice control could be cool for gaming, but it lacks the same speed that button pressing does and the 
program I used to code it is just super slow in the first place. There's also the considerations we were discussing with AR/VR, is it truly at a point where this makes sense and is better than other options we already have? Because the package is just so slow, it's clearly not better than other gaming options and probably doesn't make sense at this point or at least for this functionality.
